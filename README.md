  <h3 align="center">Chatting Socket</h3>

  <p align="center">
In order to put some knowledge of design patterns, I decided to program something that could use as many design patterns as possible. Thus, associated with the desire to learn about socket in java, I put into practice the two areas of knowledge in this project. An application that uses sockets usually consists of a server part and several clients. A client requests a certain service from the server, the server processes the request and returns the information to the client.

## About The Project

In order to put some knowledge of design patterns, I decided to program something that could use as many design patterns as possible. Thus, associated with the desire to learn about socket in java, I put into practice the two areas of knowledge in this project. An application that uses sockets usually consists of a server part and several clients. A client requests a certain service from the server, the server processes the request and returns the information to the client.

### Built With
